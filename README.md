## About

**FORCE** is an all-in-one processing engine for medium-resolution Earth Observation image archives. FORCE uses the data cube concept to mass-generate Analysis Ready Data, and enables large area + time series applications. With FORCE, you can perform all essential tasks in a typical Earth Observation Analysis workflow, i.e. going from data to information.

FORCE natively supports the integrated processing and analysis of

* Landsat 4/5 TM,
* Landsat 7 ETM+,
* Landsat 8 OLI and
* Sentinel-2 A/B MSI.

Non-native data sources can also be processed, e.g. Sentinel-1 SAR data or environmental variables.
