FORCE v. 3.10.00
===============

Release: 06.11.2025

**Read through the changelog of :ref:`v3900` closely. In this version, there are some important changes that may affect your workflows!**

- **General**

    - Vincent Schut noticed that FORCE 3.9.x was using more memory than previous versions.
      This version fixes this by introducing dynamic strings.
      Additionally, a memory leak in HLPS v3.8.01 was discovered (though that was already fixed in 3.9.x).
