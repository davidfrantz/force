Version History
===============

This section displays the changelogs for each published FORCE version.

FORCE uses a three-level versioning scheme, e.g. v. 3.0.1.
It is highly recommended to update once a new release is available.

It is also suggested to keep track of the development version, which includes the latest features.
The main version is periodically updated once a sufficient set of new features becomes available.
The develop version is intended to be a stable software version, but will need more frequent user adaptions, e.g. when new parameters become available.

- 1st level = major release:
  Disruptive changes will result in a new major release.

- 2nd level = major release:
  Major changes like completely new features will result in a new major release.

- 3rd level = patch level: 
  Incremental patches, additions, and bugfixes will result in a new patch level release.
