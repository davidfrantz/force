# Type: full file path
FILE_QUEUE = NULL
# This is the output directory where the Level 2 data will be stored. Note
# that data will be overwritten/mosaicked if you reprocess images. It is
# safe and recommended to use a single Level 2 data pool for different
# sensors (provided the same grid and projection is used). The higher-level
# programs of FORCE can handle different spatial resolutions (e.g. 30m
# Landsat and 10m Sentinel-2).

# This is a temporary directory that is used to extract compressed images
# for force-level2. Note that images already need to be extracted when using
# force-l2ps directly. The extracted data will be deleted once they were
# processed. If you cancel processing, you may want to delete any left-overs
# in this directory. A file 'cpu-$TIME' is temporarily created in DIR_TEMP.
# This file can be modified to re-adjust the number of CPUs while(!) force-
# level2 is running. Note that the effect is not immediate, as the load is
# only adjusted after one of the running jobs (images) is finished.

# MASKING
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file specifies the DEM. It is highly recommended to use a DEM. It is
# used for cloud / cloud shadow detection, atmospheric correction and topo-
# graphic correction. The DEM should be a mosaic that should completely cover
# the area you are preprocessing. If there are nodata values in the DEM, the
# Level 2 outputs will have holes, too. It is possible to process without a
# DEM (DEM = NULL). In this case, the surface is assumed flat @ z = 0m.

# spheric correction and cloud /cloud shadow detection will suffer without
# a DEM.

# RADIOMETRIC CORRECTION OPTIONS

# WATER VAPOR CORRECTION OPTIONS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the directory where the water vapor tables are located. Water
# vapor tables are not required for Sentinel-2, in this case DIR_WVPLUT
# may be NULL. For Landsat, it is recommended to use this functionality.
# As a minimum requirement, DIR_WVPLUT may be NULL and a global value
# for WATER_VAPOR needs to be specified. If a directory is given, 
# WATER_VAPOR is ignored. DIR_WVPLUT must contain water vapor tables.

# daily tables do not exist or if there is no valid daily value.
# Type: full directory path

# This indicates if the water vapor climatology tables are permitted (FALSE),
# or if only daily tables are allowed (TRUE)
# Type: Logical. Valid values: {TRUE,FALSE}
STRICT_WATER_VAPOR = FALSE
# This specifies a global value for atmospheric water vapor content in
# g cm-2. This parameter can be a dummy value to quickly process an image
# without needing to generate a water vapor database. Note that especially
# Landsat-8 is relatively insensitive to atmospheric water vapor (depending
# on wavelength), and external water vapor is not needed to process
# Sentinel-2. The error in using a dummy value is significant for the TM
# sensors.
# Type: Float. Valid range: [0,15]

# are used as fallback option.
# Type: full directory path

# CLOUD DETECTION OPTIONS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If this parameter is enabled, confident cloud detections will be erased in the 
# reflectance product, i.e. pixels are set to nodata. The cloud flag in the QAI 
# product will still mark these pixels as clouds. Use this option is disk space

# RESOLUTION MERGING
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This parameter defines the method used for improving the spatial reso-
# lution of Sentinel-2â€™s 20 m bands to 10 m. Pixels flagged as cloud or
# shadow will be skipped. Following methods are available: IMPROPHE uses
# the ImproPhe code in a spectral-only setup; REGRESSION uses a multi-
# parameter regression (results are expected to be best, but processing
# time is significant); STARFM uses a spectral-only setup of the Spatial
# and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (prediction artifacts
# may occur between land cover boundaries); NONE disables resolution merge;
# in this case, 20m bands are quadrupled.

# CO-REGISTRATION OPTIONS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This parameter specifies the acceptable tier level of Landsat Level 1 data.

# PARALLEL PROCESSING
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# utility force-level2. They are not used by the core function force-l2ps.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module is using hybrid parallelization, i.e. a mix of multiprocessing
# and multithreading. Each input image is one process, each process may use
# multiple threads. In general, it is most efficient to use as much multi-
# processing as possible (i.e. NTHREAD = 1 or 2). However, if you only have
# a small number of images - or if your system does not have enough RAM,
# it is adviced to use less processes and more threads per process. The
# number of processes and threads is given by following parameters.
# Type: Integer. Valid range: [1,...

# This parameter controls whether the individual bands of the Level 1 input
# images are read sequentially or in parallel. Note that we observed two kinds
# of GDAL installation: (1) the JPEG driver reads each band parallely, but 
# separated images in sequence - we recommend to disable PARALLEL_READS in this
# case (for Sentinel-2). (2) The GDAL JPEG driver does not do anything in 
# parallel - use PARALLEL_READ to speed up the work (also use it for Landsat).
# Type: Logical. Valid values: {TRUE,FALSE}
PARALLEL_READS = FALSE

# ful to prevent I/O jams when using a lot of processes. The delay is given
# in seconds.
# Type: Integer. Valid range: [0,...

# This parameter sets a timeout for unzipping the Level 1 data (only applies when
# images are still in zip/tar.gz format. Only applies for force-level2).

# zontal differencing; BigTiff support is enabled; the Tiff is structured 
# with striped blocks according to the TILE_SIZE (X) and BLOCK_SIZE (Y) speci-
# fications. Metadata are written to the ENVI header or directly into the Tiff
# to the FORCE domain. If the size of the metadata exceeds the Tiff's limit,
