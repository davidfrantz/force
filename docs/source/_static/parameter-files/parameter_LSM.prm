# OUTPUT OPTIONS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Output format, which is either uncompressed flat binary image format aka
# ENVI Standard, GeoTiff, or COG. GeoTiff images are compressed with ZSTD and hori-
# zontal differencing; BigTiff support is enabled; the Tiff is internally tiled 
# with 256x256 px blocks.
# Metadata are written to the ENVI header or directly into the Tiff
# to the FORCE domain. If the size of the metadata exceeds the Tiff's limit,
# an external .aux.xml file is additionally generated.
# Note that COG output is only possible when the chunk size matches the tile size.
# Type: Character. Valid values: {ENVI,GTiff,COG,CUSTOM}

# File that contains custom GDAL output options. This is only used if 
# OUTPUT_FORMAT = CUSTOM. If OUTPUT_FORMAT = CUSTOM, this file is mandatory.
# The file should be written in tag and value notation. The first two lines 
# are mandatory and specify GDAL driver and file extension, e.g. DRIVER = GTiff
# and EXTENSION = tif. The driver name refers to the GDAL short driver names. 
# Lines 3ff can hold a variable number of GDAL options (up to 32 are allowed).
# Please note: with opening output options up to the user, it is now possible to
# give invalid or conflicting options that result in the failure of creating files.

# PARALLEL PROCESSING
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module is using a streaming mechanism to speed up processing. There
# are three processing teams (3 Threads) that simultaneously handle Input,
# Processing, and Output. Example: when chunk 2 is being processed, data
# from chunk 3 are already being input and results from chunk 1 are being
# output. Each team can have multiple sub-threads to speed up the work. The
# number of threads to use for each team is given by following parameters.
# Type: Integer. Valid range: [1,...

# Use STREAMING = FALSE to disable streaming. This will perform reading, 
# computing and writing after one another in sequential mode.
# Each operation will still be parallelized with above settings.
# Disabling streaming might be necessary for some UDFs that otherwise
# produce threading conflicts with the internally used OpenMP functionality.
# Type: Logical. Valid values: {TRUE,FALSE}
STREAMING = TRUE
# This module will display progress information on screen. By default, the
# progress information overwrites itself to produce a pretty displayal. 
# However, this can cause error messages (or printing in UDFs) to be overwritten.
# If disabled (FALSE), the progress information will be simply be appended
# on screen (stdout).
# Type: Logical. Valid values: {TRUE,FALSE}

# PROCESSING EXTENT AND RESOLUTION

# be processed.
# Optional. If NULL, the complete analysis extent is processed
# Type: full file path

# This parameter is used to define the size of the sub-tile processing units.
# Most efficient is to use a chunk size that coincides with the tile size. Using 
# smaller chunks may be necessary if you cannot fit all necessary data into RAM.

# parameter is not permitted anymore.

# in the same order as given here, thus keep this in mind when training
# machine learning models with force-train.
