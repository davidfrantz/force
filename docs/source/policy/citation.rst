Citation and Acknowledgement
============================

Proper acknowledgement, and the citation of the scientific publications are kindly requested. 
Co-authorship of scientific articles should be offered in case I provide substantial help in setting up, modifying or running the software. 

Please post questions On `GitHub <https://github.com/davidfrantz/force>`_. 

I will try my best to answer your query within a reasonable amount of time. 
However, please note that I cannot guarantee user support or an immediate answer, as this is not part of my full-time job. 

For inquiries about the installation, please refer to the :ref:`install` section first; and if unsuccessful ask your administrator to set up the software before making contact. 
Inquiries about porting the code to non-supported operating systems, requesting a GUI, or similar requests will be ignored.
