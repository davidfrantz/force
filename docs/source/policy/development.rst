Development and Funding
=======================

FORCE is primarily developed by David Frantz (:ref:`contact`).
The software has emerged from my PhD research at `Trier University <https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=11839&L=2>`_, supervised by `Prof. Dr. Joachim Hill <https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=11265&L=2>`_, `online available <http://ubt.opus.hbz-nrw.
de/volltexte/2017/1046/pdf/frantz_phd.pdf>`_.

Many people have contributed to FORCE in one way or the other. 
Most prominently, these people are all the co-authors on the :ref:`refs` that are related to FORCE.
Less prominantly, but not less important, these are many of my previous and current colleagues at the `ERSG <https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=2601&L=2>`_ and `EOL <https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/en/professorships/eol/people>`_ labs that have shaped the development of FORCE through our collaborative work and many on- or off-topic discussion.
Starting with version 3.0, other people have actively developed code, which all are listed as contributors on `GitHub <https://github.com/davidfrantz/force>`_.

The development has been supported by several research projects:

* Southern African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adaptive Land Management Project (SASSCAL), funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research under grant number FKZ-01LG1201C
* Sentinel4GRIPS, funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure under grant number FKZ-50EW1605
* Near-Real Time Derivation of Land Surface Phenology using Sentinel Data: the FORCE-NRT approach, funded by the Geo.X Research Network for Geosciences in Berlin and Potsdam under grant number SO_087_GeoX
* Understanding the Role of Material Stock Patterns for the Transformation to a Sustainable Society (MAT_STOCKS), funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant number 741950
* FONDA – Foundations of Workflows for Large-Scale Scientific Data Analysis, funded by DFG under grant number  CRC-1404
