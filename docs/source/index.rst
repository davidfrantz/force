FORCE is ...
------------

... an all-in-one processing engine for medium-resolution Earth Observation image archives. FORCE uses the data cube concept to mass-generate Analysis Ready Data, and enables large area + time series applications. With FORCE, you can perform all essential tasks in a typical Earth Observation Analysis workflow, i.e. going from data to information.

FORCE natively supports the integrated processing and analysis of 

  * Landsat 4/5 TM, 
  * Landsat 7 ETM+, 
  * Landsat 8 OLI and 
  * Sentinel-2 A/B MSI.

Non-native data sources can also be processed, e.g. Sentinel-1 SAR data or environmental variables.


This user guide summarizes the technical aspects required to run FORCE. 

It will not give elaborated descriptions of methodology. For the methodological description, please refer to the scientific :ref:`refs`.
