The FORCE Level 2 Processing System (FORCE L2PS) is intended to generate harmonized, standardized and radiometrically consistent Level 2 products ( ARD: Analysis Ready Data) based on Level 1 data as provided from the space agencies. This includes cloud and cloud shadow detection, radiometric correction and data cubing. This section summarizes the usage of FORCE L2PS, its helper programs and the output format.
