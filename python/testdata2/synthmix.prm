# INPUT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# File that is holding the features, which should be mixed.
# The file needs to be a table with features in columns, and samples in rows.
# Column delimiter is whitespace. The same number of features must be given
# for each sample. Do not include a header. The samples need to match the
# response file.
# Type: full file path

# Mixing complexity, i.e. how many endmembers should be mixed together?

# one, two, three, and four endmembers, use MIXING_COMPLEXITY = 1 2 3 4.

# file (FILE_RESPONSE).
# Type: Integer list. Valid values: [1,n-classes]

# Likelihood of mixing complexity, i.e. what is the statistical likelihood
# to generate a mixture of a given mixing complexity? Multiple likelihoods 
# can be given as list, and the number and order need to match the mixing
# complexities given with MIXING_COMPLEXITY. The sum of all likelihoods 
# should be 1.

# Class likelihood, i.e. what is the statitical likelihood of drawing an
# endmember from a specific class. This parameter can be set to PROPORTIONAL
# or EQUALIZED. If PROPORTIONAL, the likelihood is based on the number of 
# samples given for each class. If EQUALIZED, the same likelihhod is given 
# to all classes. Alternatively, custom likelihhods can be defined. In this 
# case, a likelihood needs to be given for each class given in the response 
# file (FILE_RESPONSE), and the sum needs to be 1.
# Type: Character. Valid values: {PROPORTIONAL,EQUALIZED} OR
# Type: Float list. Valid values: [0,1]

# target classes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Multiple classes can be given, 
# i.e. output tables will be generated for each target class.
# Type: Integer list. Valid values: [1,n-class
